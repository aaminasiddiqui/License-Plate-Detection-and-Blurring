### Overview

___

The **detect_and_blur_plate function** is used to detect regions likely containing license plates and blur these regions. This can be useful for privacy reasons when sharing images or videos where license plates need to be obscured.
The function description is as follows:
1. **Copying the Image**: The function begins by creating copies of the input image 'img' to 'plate_img' and ROI to avoid modifying the original image.

2. **Detecting License Plates**:
  - The function uses the 'plate_cascade' (a pre-trained classifier, typically using **Haar cascades**) to detect rectangular regions in the image that likely contain license plates.
  - The **detectMultiScale** method returns a list of rectangles, each represented by (x, y, w, h) where (x, y) is the top-left corner and (w, h) are the width and height of the rectangle.

3. **Blurring Detected Regions**:
   For each detected rectangle:
   - The region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the detected license plate is extracted from roi.
   - The extracted ROI is blurred using a median blur.
   - The blurred ROI is then placed back into the corresponding location in 'plate_img'.

4. **Returning the Processed Image**: The function returns the modified image 'plate_img' where the detected license plates are blurred.
